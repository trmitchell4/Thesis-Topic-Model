       " \"Policy Concerning Fire Management in Wilderness Areas Forest Service | U.S. Department of Agriculture I | INTRODUCTION This is in response to Congressman Leggett : request for a statement of Forest Service policy concerning fire mana gement in wilderness areas | This information was requested of Mr . llenry DeBruin who was a technical witness for the Forest Service during oversight hearings concerning the fire at the Seney National Wildlife Refuge o | II POLICY The policy for fire mana agement on National Forest lands , including wilderness s appears as a number of statements in the Forest Service Manual I Following are general policy statements with references to specific manual sections which are inc luded in the Appendix to this statement : A. Fire suppression will be fast s energetic and thorough ( (Appendix item A ) | B. If the fire escapes initial attack, plans will be made and executed to obtain control before 10: :00 o'clock the next morning ( Appendix item B ) | I C | Exceptions to the 10: 00 a.m | policy may be made only under prepared plans which have been approved at the Chief E s level (item C). D. Damage caused by the suppression action to the environment must be minimized (item D ) | E | With certain exceptions | ecological processes will be allowed to operate na turally in wilderness ( item E) . F. Fires in wilderness will be controlled to prevent unacceptable loss and spread to lands outside the wilderness ( item F ). G | Fire may be used as a wilderness management tool under prescribed conditions and safeguards (item G ) 0. H | The land manager may use the tools he needs to react to emergencies (item H ) | \",\n",
       " '2 I | The manual carries instructions burning for the plans (item preparation of I). prescribed III I APPLICATION OF THE FIRE MANAGEMENT POLICY The land manager who applies the Fire Management Policy on National Forest land is is a trained fire manager or has available to him a staff specialist who will make recommendations concerning the suppression and use of fire. o Fire manager - 1 qualifications include experience in the use of prescribed fire , the suppression of wildfire , training in suppression tactics , fire behavior , business management in fire suppression and fire ecology | Fire suppression on all National Forest lands is based on prepared plans which specify the levels of manning and action to be taken under measured fire danger conditions | In considering the use of prescribed fire as a land management too1 , the land manager will first identify the ob jectives for the management of a particular tract of National Forest land | Based on his knowledge of fire ecology he will then determine the conditions under which fire may be beneficial in reaching land management objectives | He will then prepare a plan describing the conditions under which fire will be used , safe- guards to assure that the fire remains under control 1 and suppression action in the event of an emergency | Basically , there is little difference between the application of prescribed fire in a wilderness and on commercial forest land | Wilderness fires are usually started by a natural cause 1 such as lightning | Since a separate plan is prepared for each wilderness area , the wilderness plan will devote more space to broad objectives , fire history 1 and ecological considerations | ',\n",

       " '2 Fire by prescription is not new in forestry | Land and resour rce managers have been using this tool for many years to improve grazing conditions and wildlife habitat | to get rid of logging debris and unwanted vegetation , to reduce the fire hazard s and for other purposes | Starting in the 1940s , for example s the southern states have been burning by prescription up to 23, million acres per year for various forestry purposes | Nationally , the Forest Service s in the natural course of planned activities during fiscal year 1973 , burned 498,000 acres under prescription to accomplish a variety of specific land management jobs , such as slash reduction s wildlife habitat improvement | etc a But in recent years , some new concepts of fire by prescription have been evolving which make this a more useful--and more complex --tool. The following actions reflect this evolution : * Starting in the Everglades National Park in the 1950s s the National Park Service pioneered a program of using fire under a very broad prescription over large areas to establish and maintain natural ecosystems It was planned to allow fire to assume its historic role in shaping the environment | This work was continued in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in the 1960s s and it is now being used on 3 million acres in 12 park areas . From 1968 to 1974 | a total of 276 fires have burned more than 30,000 acres in this program I Practically all of these fires were caused by lightning and burned in areas of relatively high elevation a ',\n",
       " '3 * From 1968 to 1974 | the Park Service ignited 270 fires under relatively tight prescriptions | burning 37,700 acres for the purpose cf re-establishing more natural vegetative conditions * In 1972 : the Forest Service began a wilderness fire management program in the Selway =Bitterroot Wilderness in Idaho | The two units , which have to date been approved by Chief as exceptions to regular fire suppression policy s total 133,000 acres | So far | six fires have burned a total of 1,200 acres in these management areas | The objective is to permit fire to assume its natural role where this is compatible with land use and resource management plans | ak Another approach is being tried in the Francis Marion and the Kisatchie National Forests of Region 8 | This concept called UDESCONS (Designated Con trolled Burning System ) applies to units which have already been planned for prescribed burning | If a fire should occur (lightning or man -caused I other than when planned s the District Ranger may elect to allow the fire to continue burning until it reaches pre-designated natural or man made barriers s such as streams or roads | His decision is governed by a prescription covering burning conditions and also by the land management goals for the unit - | The DES CON plans are also exceptions to regular fire suppression policy and 1 therefore s required approveal by the Chief To date s in the DES CON progran 1 four fires have burned 275 acres to accomp lish several specific forestry jobs .

Use--Use of fire to meet land management goals and objectives This includes using prescription fire for the protection , enhancement and maintenance of resources. 3. | Q. What is a Prescription? A. A predesigned set of criteria established for fuel and weather conditions , topography I s and other variables , within which a fire will be constrained. 4. Q. What is meant by a Prescription Fire? A. A fire burning within a set of prescribed conditions S | The fire may result from either planned or unplanned ignitions | 5. Q. Can Prescription Fire benefit Resources Management? A. Yes I Examples of prescription fire benefits are * (1 ) Creating more browse for deer and other wildlife , (2 ) removing brush and Small trees in the understory to release young timber stands from competition s (3 ) converting brushlands to tree planting sites 1 I (4) converting and improving brushlands for cattle grazing, and (5 ) reducing the fire threat to tree plantations 1 campgrounds 1 communities and other public and private improvements S.

The revised policy complies with existing laws and does land more flexibility regulations | The revised policy allow identified managers to meet resource management needs in Fire Management Areas that have been preplanned and approved in advance by the Regional Forester. | 14. Q. Why is the Forest Service revising its Fire Management Policy? A. Our fire management programs need to be more cost effective and responsive to meeting land management objectives | The fire job on the National Forest has changed from simply putting out all fires as fast as possible regardless of cost. A critical evaluation of our fire policy brought recognition of the potential for bene ficial use of fire in protecting and managing resources in the National Torests | as well as the need for effective fire prevention and suppression programs The revision is an interim step in integrating fire management into the land mana 1 gement planning requirements of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 and the 1974 Resource Planning Act. 15. Q. Is this a \"Let Burn\" Policy? A. Absolutely not! \"Let Burn I occurs when there is an unplanned fire start and no suppression action is taken. Under the revised policy each wildfire ignition requires a positive suppression action even if the fire is in an approved Fire Management Area. | All fires are to be managed under the criteria in the approved prescription.

One or more parcels of land with common fire management objectives | 20 | Q. What is a Fire Management Objective? A. The planned , measurable result desired from fire protection and fire use to achieve land management goals and objectives | 21. Q. Why are we using Fire Management Areas? A. By designating specific fire management areas , we will orderly provide an transition from our current fixed protection objectives , established in the 1972 fire plan, to interim Fire Management Area objectives. By 1983 , fire objectives management for all National Forest areas will be developed I through the land management planning process. 22. Q. Who develops and recomnends the establishment of Fire Management Areas and Objectives? A. The Forest Supervisor. Each Fire Management Area will have a set of mana gement objectives which will be responsive to land and resource management goals and objectives ; provide for interdisciplinary and cooperator involvement ; emphasize protection from threats to life, property A | and public safety : utilize the environmental analysis process ; provide for written emphasize agreement with affected cooperating landowners and agencies : economic cons ideration and provide for a cost-effective program consistent with management objectives : and be responsive to the letter and intent of applicable laws and regulations | \",\n",

Regions 1, 9 and the northern parts of Regions 2 and 4 had favorable weather conditions o Most of Region 1 forests were in the \"easy 1 class for fire dan gerc Regions t 3, 5 s and the southern parts of Regions 2 and 4 had very unfavorable fire weather a Region 3 experienced the mos t critical fire weather of their history : it started two months early and lasted throughout the year : precipitation was 50% of normal : winds up to 110 miles per hour and 60-70 mile winds were common. Region 5 had the most severe fire weather of the past 25 yearso In s southern California it was the seventh consecutive dry year lon gest such period since 1830 There were six Santa Anna wind storms * Region 61s spring seas on and September were drier than normal but they did not have the usual extended period of dry east winds a Region 7 had favorable weather except for very severe weather in the southern part of the region in the spring season (highest fire danger since records began in 1943 ) . Region 8\\'s coastal area had the most prolon experience ged winter drought in the of the region 1 The interior areas was more favorable.

However s there was a sharp reduc s tion in the number of man 1952, caused fires ; 1034 less than recorded during Calendar Year while the number of lightning fires 1953 increased 1031 over the number experienced during 1952. during Region 1, after an unusually dry f'all in 1952, exnerienced a normal snow pack over the higher terrain with cool damp weather being the rule through June. a The months of July 5 September and October were outstanding exceptionally dry I High fire danger also ocourred during August. The feature of the 1953 fire season is found in the nunber of dry lightning storms experienced. o The bulk of these lightning storms were in August when 1036 lightning fires were reported. The total nunber of lightning fires increased from 630 in 1952 to 1357 in 1953. Man caused fires also increased from 357 during 1952 to Lh in 1953, the largest number since 1940. A hunting large share of the man caused fires occurred during the big game season in October and November * The total area burned in all ownerships was 11,569 acres largest acreage 1945. s representing the burn of since Region 2, experienced a below normal snowfall during the winter months. e During fpril and iiay precipitation in Colorado and South Dakota was near normal. Forests in Wyoming encountered high temperatures and sub- normal precipitations which resulted in a rapid melting of snow and an early runoff which in turn caused a critical June fire situation in that area. The 67 fires reported in June reflects a situation similar to A i A June 1952.

       " 'FIRE PREVENTION AND CONTROL ON THE NATIONAL FORESTS. By F A SILCOX Associate District Forester THE IMPORTANCE OF FIRE PROTECTION No plan of forest management produces results unless it has as its essential feature an adequate system of fire protection ; this is fundamental. Fire can wipe out in an hour or two the work of many decades 3 and it is obvious that the forester , who must wait on an average about one hundred years for results, would be advo- cating an impracticable policy unless results were reasonably certain. If the crop is to be harvested it must be protected from fire during the time of its growth. It is worse than useless to devise plans to assure future growth if this future growth is to be burned up. The establishment of nurseries for the production of young trees to be planted in the forests and also the reseeding of cut-over areas to insure reproduction would be manifestly fruitless opcrations if | when the young growth was secured, it were to be destroyed by fires that would necessitate repetitions of the work. That the fire menace is a real one needs no emphasis. The records of the great IIinckley fire of 1894 in Minnesota, the Fernie fire of 1908 in British Columbia, and the great fires which have recently swept the western United States b are but a history very small part of forest- fire ; but they show the possibilities under a combination of bad conditions. The forester can read from old burnt-over areas the history of the past fires and can trace their effects. The record shows a periodic recurrence of bad fires 1 which seem to come at intervals of from fifteen to twenty years. It is a simple proposition : if | timber is to be raised, and if it takes from seventy-five to one hun- dred and twenty-five years to secure the crop, some adequate method must be found to prevent the periodic recurrence of severe fires. Suc- cess Or failure in meeting this problem means success or failure in the application of practical forestry | THE CHARACTER OF THE REGION TO BE PROTECTED. To appreciate the problem one must have a clear conception of the type of country in the National Forests , and also some idea of their extent. Except for small areas in Florida, Minnesota , Michigan c Kansas, and the Dakotas, the National Forests include the great mountain watersheds of the West. They lie along the crest of the main divides of the Rockies. , the Cascades, and the Coast ranges. 413 ',\n",

The detailed reports of the Forest being Service for 1909 roads first placed the rail- as the most common of3,138 cause of fires on Forests. Out the National fires reported, 1,186 and their were caused setting due by locomotives 3, was to three principal reasons- the use fuel, of coal as the lack of proper clearing of the right of way, , and the non- use or misuse of - spark arresters. The railroad's right of way is usually from 100 to 200 feet wide : in many places within the National Forests the brush and debris has never been properly cleared up on the right of way after the larger timber has been removed, and dry punk logs and debris form the most infammable kind of material for ignition by a spark from the engine. Furthermore, the heavy grades in the mountains require a full and forced exhaust on the engines in order that sufficient steam may be kept up. Most of the spark arresters now in use interfere with the draft and, as a result, the wire screen must be knocked out or opened up so that the engine may get up the difficult grades. The more modern and larger locomotives have a return draft by which the larger cinders are forced back to the fire box before being emitted through the stack. Despite the improvement, both in en- gines and spark arresters, the railroads still hold first place as a cause of forest fires. FIRES CAUSED BY LIGHTNING The second great cause of fires, and the only one which can be classed as nonpreventable, is lightning . During dry seasons many electrical storms occur over mountain regions and set numerous small fires when lightning strikes a tree and starts a fire in the debris and humus on the ground below 7 The scarred trunks of old trees with a straight or spiral scar through the bark, from top to root, show the effects of lightning | These lightning-scarred trees are readily found in any large body of timber P During the dry season of 1910 there were many electrical storms, and innumerable small fires were found immediately afterwards. If the storm is accompaniedby rain there is, of course : little or no danger ; but it is more usual for these mountain electrical storms to be unaccompanied by rain. In 1909 there were reported 294 fires originating from this cause. LACK OF CARE BY CAMPERS. Approximately 407,000 people go to the National Forests for recreation each year P Many of these people are out for a week or two at a time to hunt or fish or just to enjoy outdoor life in the hills. Unfortunately s many of the campers either are careless or are igno- rant of the proper handling of camp fires. The carelessness takes the form of leaving the fires unextinguished, or in throwing about cigar \",\n",

The laws are stringent enough and convic- tions could unquestionably be secured : but the difficulty is to catch the offender and prove the case. The Forest officers have the authority to arrest without warrant a man seen setting a fire, but so far prac- tically no arrests of this character have been made. The incendiary not only covers his tracks, but the fire itself effectively wipes out any clues MISCELLANEOUS CAUSES OF FIRES. In addition to those from well-known causes, there are many fires which occur from miscellaneous causes not easily classified.

       " '418 YEARBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE O FOR RAILROADS. O To prevent the innumerable small fires set by railroads oil must r ultimately be used as a fuel. An efficient spark arrester which will 1 keep large glowing embers from being thrown out into the dry grass, brush, or debris usual along the right of way will assist will not entirely prevent fires. The difficulty securing greatly, but lies in a wire screen with a mesh small enough to catch the sparks, yet not so small as to interfere with the exhaust. Many different styles of screens have been devised in an attempt to overcome these difficulties. The use of a large-meshed screen is being made possible to some extent by special arresters which catch the larger cinders in a cuplike rim on the inside of the stack X the theory being that the heavier sparks, under forced draft, are held by centrifugal force close to the the stack : any obstruction properly placed perimeter of therefore, such on the in- side of the stack should stop the large cinders, which are the main cause of the fires. There must be some way to prevent those which do get away from starting fires, and the only effective one is to clear the right of way of all inflammable material. There should be no standing tim- ber , no odically, punk logs and debris, and it should then be burned over peri- under careful supervision, to prevent further accumulation of inflammable stuff I Through open country it is best to plow a furrow or two at the outer edge of the right of way to serve as a fire break 7 The method to be adopted depends to a great extent on topography. Two to four furrows on each side of the track are usually sufficient. In addition : it is way every heavy necessary to patrol the right of immediately after freight train, by a man On a speeder | Caches of fire-fighting tools should be located at each section house and at other stations along the right of way | These may be boxes similar to those used by contractors, placed at the most summoning strategic points.

To prevent fires, all campers should observe the following simple rules | Clear thoroughly of debris a space of about 10 feet around the place where the fire is to be built. Build small and not large fires. Never leave a fire burning s no matter how safe it might appear ; put it out, either with water Or dirt, and use special precaution to put out punky logs, since they burn for a long time. These three simple rules, if followed, will prevent any conflagration from camp fires. Campers should not risk themselves or jeopardize others who wish to enjoy the woods. If they are careless the severest penalty under the law should be inflicted. FO FARMERS. The system adopted by many of the timbered States to make effec- tive closed during which time no brush can be burned with- a season permit is helping tremendously to reduce the danger from settlers out burning brush. Many States now provide for a closed season and compulsory brush burning during such time as it is safe. \",\n",
       " '420 YEARBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. PREVENTION TIIROUGH LIGISLATION ANI EDUCATION Plainly noticeable on every road or trail in the National Forests are fre-warning notices. The essential feature of these notices is an outline of the Federal law against setting or leaving any fire. It states that malicious fire setting is met with a punishment of $5,000 fine or two years in prison or both : careless fire setting with $1,000 fine or one year in prison or both. Practically .all of the States have enacted forest-fire laws. With very few exceptions all of the early legislation provided for penal- ties rather than for fire prevention. The more recent acts emphasize preventive measures. They provide in brief for the creation of fire districts upon the request of any timber owners in a given locality : the selection of a fire warden by the petitioners and ratification of his appointment by the State : the prohibition of brush burning dur- ing the dry season unless a permit is secured from the State fire warden : the compulsory burning of slash during the early spring or late fall in order to eliminate danger from logging - In practically all of the western States s but more particularly in Idaho, Oregon :, Washington , California, and Montana, aggressive steps are being taken in the direction of adequate fire protection. COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS. Many of the forestry and conservation associations of the West are carrying on an active propaganda of education not only among the timber owners, but among the people at-large. That this work is achieving results is shown by the fact that the lumber owners them | selves have organized associations in which each one of the members is assessed according to his acreage. The funds cover hiring expenses of guards and temporary fire fighters , of keeping horses, and of equipping men with tools. The primary campaign purpose of this educa - tional is to impress in a vivid, lasting way the a forest fire in meaning of losses to the Nation, 1, to the State, and to the local community | Such organized associations are of the greatest practical benefit to the National Forests where the holdings of lumber companies and the National Government are intermixed, and cooperation cation, prevents makes dupli- the work effective, and properly places expenses and re- sponsibilties. territory Cooperative agreements provide for a division of the into cooperative districts, which districts are determined by the topography and extent of the private and Government hold- ings and of the areas ing which are not included in either ; a of the prorat- expenses of basis fighting fires in the the the proportion district holdings division cooperative district on of of : a of each into patrol units and cooperative a definite agreement at the beginning ',\n",

Similar cooperative agreements are entered into with individual lumber companies or with owners who are not members of the asso- ciation, where their holdings are of sufficient protection acreage to make it advisable. Ordinarily the of these areas would have to be assumed by the Government in order to protect its own holdings s and this plan of cooperation places the responsibility for pro- tection control on these privately owned lands where it belongs 1 -on the private owners themselves and not on the Government. The value of this kind of cooperation can not be overestimated in the general plan of fire protection in the National Forests. CONTROL OF FIRES. It is axiomatic that to control fires they must be discovered and reached when they are small. In a city the location of the fire-alarm boxes SO that a report of the fire can be sent to the engine houses : the arrangement whereby anyone may turn in the alarm and can therefore act as a patrolman ; the use of electrical appliances for trans- mitting the alarm ; the complete readiness of men , horses | and engines to move on the first signal For the substitution of the motor for the horse-pulled engine ; the readiness of all vehicles and pedestrians to give entire right of way to the engines all these bespeak a combina- tion for most quickly locating and reaching a fire. On the National Forests the problem in essence is the same. Fire engines scarcely can be the quick calling for assistance | used, but the reporting of fires , and the keeping in readiness of necessary tools and equipment is can be had. THE NATIONAL FOREST FORCE. First, the Forest is divided into ranger districts to distribute the patrol force properly and to fix the responsibility for a specific piece of territory on a permanently employed ranger , who can become \",\n",
       " \"422 Y EARBOOK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF thoroughly familiar with the country in which he is to work. knowledge This is important, since much depends upon the ranger's of the topography of his district. The size of the ranger district varies b but under present conditions is altogether too large. In no case should it include more than two townships, or approximately 72 square miles. Since the ranger must not only oversee the fire-protec- tion work : but must handle the administrative work 1 such as making estimates maps and reports on timber sales = must exercise , general supervision over the construction of roads and trails ; and make examination of claims it is necessary to have additional men to assist in patrolling the territory | These additional men are needed mainly during the fire season | from June to October 0 and are employed temporarily as guards to assist the ranger in patrol work. To prop- erly distribute these additional men :. the ranger subdivides his district into patrol units, to each of which he assigns a Forest guard. From 1 to 10 Forest guards are assigned to a ranger , depending 1 of course, on the size of his district and the comparative danger from fires. Pl. XXVII | fig. 1. ) The unit of patrol varies according to the character of the country . In the very heavily timbered regions of the coast and Northwest one man can not adequately cover , even with every facility for readily getting over the country , more than from 25,000 to 30,000 acres. In the more lightly timbered regions where there are a great many open parks, one man can cover from 50,000 to 60,000 acres. This would mean for a Forest of 1,000,000 acres a patrol force | not including rangers Bs of thirty-three men. LOOKOUT POINTS. After dividing the Forest into ranger districts and subdividing the districts into patrol units, with a man in charge of each, it is still necessary to make sure that these men are in a position to render effective service. The ranger must select certain lookout points and ridges from which he can see over his entire district. A view from these discovering high points will, in many cases be worth a great deal more for fires than patrol lower down ; hence these points are carefully selected and coordinated to give primary control of the entire Forest, They are generally high isolated peaks from which an unobstructed view may be obtained. If possible they should be in sight of each other , SO that two men can locate a fire taking accurately by triangulation compass bearings. ( Pl. XXXI. ridges fig . 2.) Yet these lookout points and are of little value if after the fire is discovered there is no way to get to it quickly, because of a lack of trails, or no way to call for immediate help. Travel without trails through mountainous regions, over windfall and be foot through brush, must on ; the time lost in getting to a fire is a serious matter | Where \",\n",

Permanent trails must be built to make the They should be all of the country accessible. along main streams and ridges as trunk trails, then up the tributaries and on the spurs as laterals. The sys- tem must be complete, comprehensive, and coordinated in order to make it possible for a man on horseback to reach patrol any portion of his fire unit within a few hours. In case the fire gets a start and it becomes necessary to bring in a number of men and many supplies | even better means of transportation must be provided, These can be secured only through wagon roads as far as they can be constructed and then trails for pack animals. Pack trains of from eight to thirty horses should be kept on each Forest where there is risk of delay in getting horses fron the outside. These horses may be distributed over the Forest on trail construction work, or used for packing sup- plies and carrying mail to the patrolmen away back in the hills, So that the men will not have to leave their stations to come out for two Or three days at a time during a critical period. When a large fire occurs which can not be handled by the local force of rangers and guards and assistance is needed, the telephone gets word to the supervisor in town | who, in most cases, is a on the railroad, and help is sent in. The horses are called into service from their routes or construction work and put to packing supplies to the fire camps. The caches of tools at strategic points throughout the Forest contain enough tools to equip from ten to fifteen men. Larger caches at central of distribution in the Forest provide against the loss of which points time would result if they had to be packed in, in addition to the food supplies for the men. ( (Pl.

To stop the ground fires, trenches are dug from 2 to 4 feet wide down to mineral soil, the brush and debris being thrown away from the fre. When the fire reaches this line, unless it is burning very intensely , under a high wind, it will stop. Patrols are established along this entire fire line to keep it from crossing | Some men fight these ground fires by getting very close to them , simply following the fre line as it extends : others cut their line some distance ahead and then back fire from the line. Both methods are good : but are applicable to different types. In open stands of timber close fighting is best : in the heavy underbrush close fighting is out of the question. The tools used for trenching are the mattock or grub hoe, shovel, axe, and cross-cut saw I Each crew usually contains from fifteen to twenty men . having tools in the proportion of two mattocks for each shovel or axe. For example fifteen men would be using five shovels or axes and ten mattocks. Such a crew can build about 1 to 2 miles of fire trenches in a day | ( Pl. XXIX : fig. 1 I : Pl. XXXII, fig. 1.) Under high winds the ground fires may start top fires, that is, the fire runs up the dry moss on a tree or catches some of the lower branches, which in turn catch the next, and the crown fire is started. The fire crew then selects a place some distance ahead of the fire and puts in a trench and also cuts the trees for a space about 20 feet wide. A back fire is set near enough to the advancing fire for the back draft to bring the two together and cause them to burn out. I With a hurricane-like wind the only thing to do is to get out of the Way as quickly as possible. O ',\n",

Lightning fires When a lightning storm is expected, the fire pro- m tection organization can better estimate the danger that lightning fires will be set if it is known what materials are nost likely to be ignited by lightning strikes | If, for example, most lightning fires start in needles and duff and if the duff too wet to burn on the day the storm was ex - , were pected , there probably would be little danger of fires a If s on thc other hand , the duff were very dry there would be plenty of danger to prepare for | Over the region as a whole fires have started , 42% of the lightning in the necdles and duff | This means that neorly half of the lightning fire danger depends on the inflonmability of the needles and duff o When the duff is sooking wet the lightning fire danger probably is less than half of the danger which exists when the duff is dry 1 The most outstanding difference between the West Side and East Side forests in the matcrial first ignited by lightning strikes is in regard to snags a On the West Side forests 25% of the lightning fires start in snags in contrast to only 10% on the East Side.

       " 'LIGHINING FIRE STUDIES Lightning Fire Altitude Zones Since lightning is the cause of half of the forest fires in the national forests of Washington and Oregon it is important to know where they factor occur | It is often said that altitude is an important in determining their distribution a This nssumption has been tested by tabu- lating by forests all the lightning fires which started in each 2,000- foot altitude zone from 1925 to 1930 inclusive. On the West Side forests as a whole s 51% of the lightning fires have strrted at altitudes between 4,000 and 6,000 feet, 34% were betveen 2,000 and 4,000 feet, 9% started below 2,000 fect, and only 6% originated nt altitudes above 6,000 fect. East Side forests show higher general altitudes for lightning fires than the West Side forests , because the land rises from a platecu which in most places is more than 2,000 feet above sea level o Here 61% of the light- ning fires occurred between 4,000 and 6,000 feet o Only 22% started between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, and only 2% started belov 2,000 feet altitude | This altitudinal distribution of lightning fires compared with man caused fires demonstrates the diffcrent characteristics of the two types | Only 12% of the West Side man n-caused fires started at altitudes between 4,000 and 6,000 fect as compared with 51% of the lightning fires.

       " 'FIRE DAMAGI STUDIES Logging as a Cause of Forest Fires It is generally recognized that practically all logging operations tend to increase both the fire hazard and the fire danger | First of all because logging converts the green forest which is a relatively safe type into slash and cut-over land vhich are highly inflammable s because the presence of numbers mcn and types and sec- ond large of the operation of machinery in the highly inflonmable debris incident to logging are in them- selves potent causes of fires starting a The very real danger of losing valuable property such as equipment and logs by fire has forced loggers to take certain precautions in their own sclf interest.

However s in spite of all the precautions taken in self interest and the statutory regulation s logging fires have caused enormous loss of property | In order to demonstrate the role played by logging and logging fires in the losses caused by forest fires in the last decade an analysis has been made of the state forester 1 / individual reports of all fires occurring on private lands in fifteen counties in the Douglas fir region in Oregon for the period 1921 to 1932 inclusive a This comparison of the destructive- ness of logging fires versus all other fires is presented in the accompany a ing tables | A study of these tables will reveal that although logging is credited with causing but 11% of the total number of fires in the period studicd s logging as a cause is responsible for 26% of the total 23% the loss area burned s of of nerchantable tinber s 49% of the loss of equipment, logs and 37% of logging the total damage and 35% of the total fire fighting cost.

I GISBORNF Senior Silchniteurintooras Forest Protection Research, Northern Rocky Experiment Station This topic was assigned to the author at the recent tire research meeting at Priest River Experimental Forest, Idaho.

The creation of a widespread framework of forest reserres in 1904, 1905, 1906, and 1907 Here was the real beginning of all future Nation-wide problems in fire-control objectives, methods, and finance. All previous prob- lems had been relatively local. All State and private major of fire control have likewise appeared since the Government problems Federal began to practice forestry on a national scale. Hence. Sargent compiled the first fire statistics in 1880, although the active history of fire control seems to me to conmence in 1904. 1905. In 1905 there was born the first coonerative avreementand work plan between private and State timber protective arencies. This move proved to be SO profitable and so beneficial that the formal Northwest cooperative protection movement spread rapidly, first throuhout the and subsequently throughout the Nation.

Each season brings its variety of fire problems but the natural laws re- main constant | The complexity of problems is due to the lack of knowledge on our part of the laws that control the fine situation.

On the other hand an accumulation of water vapor soon builds up a barrier that baffles the wildest raging fires and subdues them | The con- dition of the air with reference to thie quantity of water vapor is known as humidity, and can be easily determined existing at any time by a reading with a small instrument consisting of thermometers, taking two known as a psychrometer | Relative humidity is the percentage of saturation of the air | and largely governs its humidity absorbing or evaporating controlling power.

Since relative inflammability humidity has a di- rect bearing on the degree of humidity 1 and since this can be de- termined , a record of relative therefore can be used as an indicator of the fire hazard. The greatest fire hazard exists when the forest materials have dried to the fammability point where the moisture content is less than that of their in- point. Under such conditions fires the materials spread rapidly because ahead of the fire ignite readily immediately without having to be dried out and inflammable advance fires are started by sparks.

The greatest aid in fire prevention is a knowledge of when critical conditions are developing and when extra precautionary measures are necessary. Such conditions are shown by the relative humidity records of the previous few hours or possibly days or nights. These indications afford an opportunity for preparing for any emergency that may arise as well as providing a plan of action on existing fires. The fluctuations of the inflammability of the forest matierials has long been recognized 1 but the fact that these daily or periodic fluctuations were caused by the changes of relative humidity has not been known. The establishment of this definite relation of the relative humidity to the inflammability of the forest has thrown a new light on the whole field of forest fire prevention and control. The smoldering fire changed into a raging conflagration within a few hours is not unfamiliar to those who have dealt with, and observed 1 forest fires. The fire that was beyond control one hour and quiet the next has likewise often been encountered. But how to know what the fire may be expected to do has always been left to conjecture. The dis- covery that these hourly or daily fluctuations of the fire are due to rela- tive humidity furnishes a mieans of knowing why the fire varies SO quickly and makes possible a determination of the possible condition of the fire ',\n",

Rain, in varying amounts from a inches few to nearly an inch had occurred Northwest during throughout the Pacific region the period of May 21 to May 26 and there wene no indications of a possible fire period. The forest floor was wet and smoldering fires were apparently harmless. Nevertheless all fires began picking up on May 28 and several developed into raging con- flagrations within the day . Many other fines started within the period ot low humidity and the greater number of them were destructive C un 1- controllable fires S. In fact during s this four day period : in May, long be- fore the normal opening of the fire season in this region 1 and immediate- ly after heavy rains there was probably more acreage burned over and , greater damage sustained than during the entire balance of the season. The period of low humidity continued until May 31 on the west side of the Cascade Mountains and until June 1 the east side and each on succeeding day made the conditions more hazardous : This extremely hazardous period however passed as quickly as it came and ended with- accompanied by east wind . which is usually the out rainfall. It was an case in this region : although periods of low humidity may occur accom- panied by winds from any direction.

This same page of history will be continued just as long as the smoldering fire is a part of the accepted fire risk of the forest Unquestionably regions. one of the main causes of our enormous fire losses has been due to the failure to realize how very suddenly forest materials may change from a low degree of inflammability to an degree of inflammability, convert hours, extremely and fires which high in a few have been smoldering harmlessly for days into raging conflagrations. A realization of this situation can lead to only one conclusion :, that the smoldering fires must be put out immediately while they are small | when they can be handled at small expense and before conditions change. DAILY CONDITIONS DUE TO RELATIVE HUMIDITY | The variations in relative humidity within the day are of mount importance in fire control. A continuous of humidity para- record serves as an index to the atmospheric conditions. The possible conditions for the day are the generally indicated by the morning humidity record as early as reight o'clock in and extreme periods are often indicated earlier. I The first index of the approach of a period of low humidity was recorded as early as 4 A. M. on May 27, 1922, and a record bf 21 per cent at 8 I A. M. indicated that the air was early extremely dry.

FIRE HAZARD DUE TO DAILY CHANGES OF * HUMIDITY An example of the relation between daily and hourly relative 1922, and the fire hazard 2. On changes in humidity is given in Figure May 14 the moisture content in per cent, based on the dry per determined weight of the materials at 110 F. and 10 cent humidity, was through- out the day. Fern, firewood and pearly everlasting wiere used because they are the inflammable materials on which early spring fines spread in open areas. The immediate response in the moisture content of these materials in direct nelation to the relative humidity is shown by the curves. The humidity fern contained 112 per cent of moisture at 5 A.

The point of greatest importance in the fluctuation of the moisture content of these materials is the variation of time at which the inflammability line is crossed by different materials. On September 10 the moisture content of the moss twigs passed above the inflammability point at 6 P. M . and the needles and not until 2 A. M. On the morning of September 11 the needles and twigs were inflammable at 8:30 A. M. and the moss did not become inflammable until 10:30 A. M A The same relative position of inflammability of the materials was main- tained each morning and evening | The consistent difference in time of inflammability of the different materials is the basis for determining when and how to burn slash or what methods to use in fire control, APPLICATION OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY RECORDS TO PROTECTION AND SUPPRESSION WORK | Definite knowledge in regard to the inflammability of forest ma- terials as indicated by the relative humidity of the present moment, and reliable information in regard to the probable changes in burning con- ditions which will take place within the next few hours as interpreted from the trend of the relative humidity curve , are of inestimable value in all phases of protection and suppression work. In connection with slash disposal it is a very dependable guide as to when slashings should be burned to obtain best results, as covered in de- tail under separate heading I It indicates when burning permits may be issued and when they should by all means be refused or even canceled. In connection with logging operations it will enable the to vary the intensity of his protective measures in with operator accordance the existing hazard, instead of trusting entirely to one standard of protection for widely varying degrees of hazard.

Relative humidity is a reliable guide in determining the Successful proper time to burn slash. burning can be done during periods of humidity, high but low burning would be dangerous and destructive during per- iors of humidity 7 A high humidity protects the surrounding open areas of highly inflammable materials such as prevents the fern, grasses , fireweed , etc., and slash fires from causing crown fires in adjacent timber | Seed trees are also protected 1 because the moist air holds the heat of the fire at a lower level and consequently the crowns of the trees are not So readily burned out.
