# Thesis-Topic-Model

This is the LDA Topic Model I created for my thesis.

Much of the code I used was originally created by the YouTube channel "Python Tutorials for the Digital Humanities," specifically from the video
"How to Create an LDA Topic Model in Python with Gensim (Topic Modeling for DH 03.03)"
